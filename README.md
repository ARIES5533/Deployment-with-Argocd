# GitOps Deployment with ArgoCD on Amazon EKS

![ArgoCD Logo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/assets/argocd.png)

This repository showcases a GitOps deployment approach for managing Kubernetes applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) using ArgoCD. With ArgoCD, you can declaratively define your application configurations using YAML files and maintain Git as the single source of truth. The ArgoCD agent is installed on your EKS cluster, which continuously monitors your Git repository to pull the latest changes and updates, ensuring your applications are always up to date.

## Overview

Managing Kubernetes applications can become complex, especially when dealing with multiple environments and versions. ArgoCD simplifies this process by enabling GitOps, a methodology where your entire application configuration is stored in a Git repository. This approach provides several benefits:

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define your application's desired state using declarative YAML files, making it easy to understand and version-controlled.

- **Git as the Single Source of Truth**: Your Git repository becomes the source of truth for your application configurations, ensuring consistency across all environments.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Updates**: ArgoCD's agent running on your EKS cluster constantly monitors your Git repository for changes. When changes are detected, it automatically updates the cluster to match the desired state.

This project demonstrates how to set up and utilize ArgoCD for a GitOps workflow on Amazon EKS, allowing you to streamline your Kubernetes deployments and reduce manual intervention.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Amazon EKS Cluster**: You should have an Amazon EKS cluster up and running.

2. **Kubectl**: Install and configure `kubectl` for interacting with your EKS cluster.

3. **Git Repository**: Create a Git repository to store your application configurations in YAML format.

### Installation

1. **Install ArgoCD on EKS**: Follow the official ArgoCD installation documentation to deploy ArgoCD on your EKS cluster.

2. **Connect ArgoCD to Your Git Repository**: Configure ArgoCD to connect to your Git repository. This typically involves setting up Git credentials and configuring the repository URL.

3. **Define Application Configurations**: Create declarative YAML files in your Git repository to define your Kubernetes applications and their desired state.

4. **Sync Applications**: Use ArgoCD's CLI or web UI to sync your applications. ArgoCD will continuously monitor your Git repository and update your EKS cluster to match the desired state.

## Usage

1. **Commit Changes to Git**: Whenever you need to make changes to your Kubernetes applications, simply update the YAML files in your Git repository.

2. **Push Changes**: Push the changes to your Git repository.

3. **ArgoCD Sync**: ArgoCD will detect the changes and automatically sync your applications, ensuring your EKS cluster matches the updated configurations.

4. **Monitor and Troubleshoot**: Monitor the deployment status and logs through the ArgoCD web UI or CLI. In case of issues, ArgoCD provides tools to troubleshoot and rollback to previous versions.

## Maintenance

### Updating ArgoCD

ArgoCD itself may receive updates and improvements over time. Keep an eye on the ArgoCD releases and documentation to stay up to date. To update ArgoCD on your EKS cluster, follow the official upgrade instructions.

### Updating Cluster Applications

As your applications evolve, update the YAML configuration files in your Git repository to reflect the desired state. ArgoCD will automatically detect these changes and apply them to your EKS cluster.
